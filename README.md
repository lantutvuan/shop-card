# Shop card

Resposive shop card with an option to slide images, leave a rating and popup a modal on plain(vanilla) JS.

I didn't face any particular difficulties, it was an interesting mini-project in general.
I tackled a lot of common tasks doing this one, this experience was very relevant and useful.
